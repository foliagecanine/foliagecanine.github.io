				<p>How to use your android device as a webcam and a microphone for your peripheral-impaired Ubuntu install</p>
				<byline>foliagecanine - 6/13/2020</byline>
				<br>
				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					Like many people around this time, I use video conferencing software almost every day.<br>
					However, like many people, I don't have a webcam or microphone for my desktop computer.<br>
					<strong>It's time to fix that.</strong><br>
					<br>
					I dual-boot Windows™ 7 (yep) and Ubuntu 20.04 for my main desktop computer.<br>
					It doesn't have a webcam or microphone (and I don't want to buy one), so I generally use a weak laptop for my video calls (the powerful one I was using died).<br>
					However, since it's so weak, there's stuttering, voice breaking, and even lag in the chat!<br>
					My desktop isn't the best, but it is much better than the laptop.<br>
					I spent a few hours working on this problem and found a solution that works relatively well.<br>
					It uses an Android™ device as both the webcam and microphone, and is completely free.<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer running Ubuntu</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It is possible that a Windows computer, or other linux distribution (especially one that uses pulseaudio and apt) will work for this. I haven't tried either. I don't know whether this will work at all on MacOS</li>
						<li>Administrator access to the computer</li>
					</ul>
					<li>A device running Android</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Ability to install apps on the android device</li>
					</ul>
					<li>An internet connection for both devices</li>
					<li>Ability to be on the same network as the Android device</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Setting up the computer</h2>
				<p>
					First, we'll install the Droidcam client from dev47apps.com (commands based off of instructions on <a href="https://www.dev47apps.com/droidcam/linuxx/">dev47apps.com/droidcam/linuxx/</a>)<br><br>
<code class="bash">sudo apt install gcc make linux-headers-`uname -r`
cd /opt
wget https://files.dev47apps.net/linux/droidcam_latest.zip
unzip droidcam_latest.zip -d droidcam && cd droidcam
sudo ./install</code><br><br>
					Then we'll make a desktop file.<br>
					Put the following text in ~/.local/share/applications/droidcam.desktop<br><br>
<code>[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Name=DroidCam
Exec=droidcam
Comment=Use your Android phone as a wireless webcam or an IP Cam!
Categories=GNOME;GTK;Video;</code><br><br>
					Now test it by going into your applications and launching Droidcam. You should see a window pop up.
					<br><br>
					Next, head over to <a href="https://github.com/pzmarzly/mic_over_mumble">https://github.com/pzmarzly/mic_over_mumble</a> and press download and download as ZIP. Save it in a place where you'll remember.<br>
					Unzip it to another folder and then use a terminal to enter the directory.<br>
					You should see a few files, including one called "mic_over_mumble"<br>
					Now type
					<code class="bash">./mic_over_mumble</code> and follow the instructions on the terminal.<br>
					At the end, it should say "Press Return to shut down"<br>
					<strong>Don't</strong> press return right now.
				</p>
				<h2>Setting up the Android device</h2>
				<p>
					First, head over to the Google Play store and find <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev47apps.droidcam">DroidCam Wireless Webcam by Dev47Apps</a><br>
					Download it.<br>
					Then search for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.morlunk.mumbleclient.free">Plumble - Mumble VOIP (Free)</a><br>
					Download that too.<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>Connecting the Android device to your computer</h2>
				<p>
					Open up the DroidCam app and it should give your phone's IP address.<br>
					On your computer, in the Droidcam window, type in the IP address shown on your Android device in the box labelled "Phone IP".<br>
					In the box labelled "DroidCam Port", type in the port shown on your Android device.<br>
					Make sure "WiFi/LAN" is selected<br>
					Make sure "Enable Video" is selected but NOT "Enable Audio"<br>
					Now click the "Connect" button.<br>
					Your phone should now show up as a webcam device labelled "Droidcam"<br>
					You can open an app like "Cheese" (photo app for Ubuntu) to test it.
					<br>
					Now press the home button on your Android device and open up the "Plumble Free" app.
					Press the + button and type in the IP address of your computer. You can find your IP address with<br>
					<code class="bash">ifconfig</code><br>
					It should not be 127.0.0.1<br>
					Now press the add button.<br>
					Tap on the new box, and you should be connected.<br>
					You can find it in the microphones as "VirtualMic"<br>
					<br>
					That's it! Now you've got a webcam and a microphone!
