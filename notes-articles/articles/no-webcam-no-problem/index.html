				<p>How to use your android device as a webcam and a microphone for your peripheral-impaired Ubuntu install</p>
				<byline>foliagecanine - 6/13/2020</byline>
				<br>
				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
				Like many people around this time, I use video conferencing software almost every day.<br>
				However, like many people, I don't have a webcam or microphone for my desktop computer.<br>
				<strong>It's time to fix that.</strong><br>
				<br>
				I dual-boot Windows 7® (yep) and Ubuntu 20.04 for my main desktop computer.<br>
				It doesn't have a webcam or microphone (and I don't want to buy one), so I generally use a weak laptop for my video calls (the powerful one I was using died).<br>
				However, since it's so weak, there's stuttering, voice breaking, and even lag in the chat!<br>
				My desktop isn't the best, but it is much better than the laptop.<br>
				I spent a few hours working on this problem and found a solution that works relatively well.<br>
				It uses an Android™ device as both the webcam and microphone, and is completely free.<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer running Ubuntu</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It is possible that a Windows® computer, or other linux distribution (especially one that uses pulseaudio and apt) will work for this. I haven't tried either. I don't know whether this will work at all on MacOS</li>
						<li>Administrator access to the computer</li>
					</ul>
					<li>A device running Android</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Ability to install apps on the android device</li>
					</ul>
					<li>An internet connection for both devices</li>
					<li>Ability to be on the same network as the Android device/li>
				</ul>
