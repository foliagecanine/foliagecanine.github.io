				<p>How to use your android device as a webcam and a microphone for your peripheral-impaired Ubuntu install</p>
				<byline>foliagecanine - 6/13/2020</byline>
				<br>
				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					Like many people around this time, I use video conferencing software almost every day.<br>
					However, like many people, I don't have a webcam or microphone for my desktop computer.<br>
					<strong>It's time to fix that.</strong><br>
					<br>
					I dual-boot Windows™ 7 (yep) and Ubuntu 20.04 for my main desktop computer.<br>
					It doesn't have a webcam or microphone (and I don't want to buy one), so I generally use a weak laptop for my video calls (the powerful one I was using died).<br>
					However, since it's so weak, there's stuttering, voice breaking, and even lag in the chat!<br>
					My desktop isn't the best, but it is much better than the laptop.<br>
					I spent a few hours working on this problem and found a solution that works relatively well.<br>
					It uses an Android™ device as both the webcam and microphone, and is completely free.<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer running Ubuntu</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It is possible that a Windows computer, or other linux distribution (especially one that uses pulseaudio and apt) will work for this. I haven't tried either. I don't know whether this will work at all on MacOS</li>
						<li>Administrator access to the computer</li>
					</ul>
					<li>A device running Android</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Ability to install apps on the android device</li>
					</ul>
					<li>An internet connection for both devices</li>
					<li>Ability to be on the same network as the Android device</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Setting up the computer</h2>
				<p>
					First, we'll install the Droidcam client from dev47apps.com (commands based off of instructions on <a href="https://www.dev47apps.com/droidcam/linuxx/">dev47apps.com/droidcam/linuxx/</a>)<br><br>
					<code class="bash">
						sudo apt install gcc make linux-headers-`uname -r`<br>
						cd /opt<br>
						wget https://files.dev47apps.net/linux/droidcam_latest.zip<br>
						unzip droidcam_latest.zip -d droidcam && cd droidcam<br>
						sudo ./install
					</code><br><br>
					Then we'll make a desktop file.<br>
					Put the following text in ~/.local/share/applications/droidcam.desktop<br><br>
					<code>
						[Desktop Entry]<br>
						Version=1.0<br>
						Type=Application<br>
						Terminal=false<br>
						Name=DroidCam<br>
						Exec=droidcam<br>
						Comment=Use your Android phone as a wireless webcam or an IP Cam!<br>
						Categories=GNOME;GTK;Video;
					</code><br><br>
					Now test it by going into your applications and launching Droidcam. You should see a window pop up.
