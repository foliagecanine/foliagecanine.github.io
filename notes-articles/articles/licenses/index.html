				<h1>Licenses? Who cares about licenses?</h1>
				<p>Which license to choose? This article goes through the various licenses.</p>

				<h2>Do I need a license?</h2>
				<p>
					Are you planning on having anyone but yourself use it? If so, yes.<br>
					By default, your work is COPYRIGHTED under an "all rights reserved" statement! That means you must give each person you give it to permission to use it.<br>
					<br>
					Even if you don't plan on making it open source or whatever, at least put an "(C) [firstname] [lastname] YEAR. All Rights Reserved" text as a license. This signifies that you don't want people to use this code, and may prevent someone from illegally using your code.
				</p>
				<h2>Everyone uses GPL. Should I?</h2>
				<p>
					It depends on the project.<br>
					Personally, I don't think anything deserves to be GPLed, but that's just me.
					Here's the pros and cons about GPL:<br>
					<strong>Pros</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>No one can use your work without credit.</li>
						<li>People can't sell your code in their software (besides things such as install discs, etc. You can technically sell GPL'd software. In most cases it would just be pointless.)</li>
						<li>People give back their contributions.</li>
						<li>Any contributors get their credit.</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Cons</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>You must license your project as GPL even if you use just a small portion of code</li>
						<li>You must make it open source</li>
						<li>You must state all significant changes made to original code</li>
						<li>Many things your linux distribution uses is GPL'd (even linux itself!)</li>
						<li>There are different versions of GPL which have different things that you can and can't do</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h2>What about LGPL?</h2>
				<p>
					In my opinion, LGPL is a bit better than GPL.<br>
					Again, it depends on the project.<br>
					However, the main difference between GPL and LGPL is that LGPL is that with GPL, you must license the entire thing as GPL if you used GPL code. With LGPL, you can just license that portion of code as LGPL. You don't have to change the entire project's license.<br>
					This makes it much more flexible when trying to use others' code as inspiration or just putting it in because it works. Otherwise, you might not be able to do that if you were using a license like the MIT license. You would have to decide between using this great code and changing the license to GPL or not using the code at all.<br>
					<br><br>
					<strong>Pros</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>... pretty much same as GPL</li>
						<li>Can use LGPL in other projects with limitations. LGPL is generally for libraries to be dynamicly linked</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Cons</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>... pretty much same as GPL</li>
						<li>Still can't use LGPL in other projects (with different licenses) in many situations</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h2>What are some other options?</h2>
				<p>
					Another somewhat popular license is the Apache License.<br>
					This license is a pretty permissive license, with additional information on patents and trademarks.<br>
					<strong>Pros</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>People can't use your work without credit</li>
						<li>People can do pretty much whatever they want with it (with exceptions)</li>
						<li>You can include it inside of other works (e.g. use one file that uses Apache license inside a project that's mostly MIT. Just be careful to do it correctly)</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Cons</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Very long and legalese document</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Considerations</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>The full copyright text (not necessarily the file) must be included, even if it's modified<li>
						<li>Any NOTICE file must be included</li>
						<li>You must state changes made to the project (can be good or bad in certain situations)</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h2>Simple and permissive</h2>
				<p>
					Another license (my personal favorite) is the MIT license<br>
					This license is a simple, permissive license that can pretty easily be read, even by those who don't know how to read legalese.<br>
					<strong>Pros</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>People can't use your work without credit</li>
						<li>People can do pretty much whatever they want with it (with exceptions)</li>
						<li>You can include it inside of other works</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Cons</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Doesn't offer specificity relating to trademarks and patents like Apache</li>
					</ol>
					Pretty much all you need to do to use MIT-licensed code is place the license with the code and you're good to go!
				</p>
				<h2>The do-whatever-you-want license</h2>
				<p>
					Lastly there's the UNLICENSE. It effectively says "I give up my copyright to the public domain."<br>
					All it includes is a statement that releases it to the public domain and a disclaimer.
					<strong>Pros</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Anyone can do anything with it as if they had created it (except the original work is in the public domain)</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Cons</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Anyone can do anything with it as if they had created it (except the original work is in the public domain)</li>
						<li>(they don't need to give credit, include a license file, etc.)
					</ol>
