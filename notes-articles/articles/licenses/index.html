				<h1>Licenses? Who cares about licenses?</h1>
				<p>Which license to choose? This article goes through the various licenses.</p>

				<h2>Do I need a license?</h2>
				<p>
					Are you planning on having anyone but yourself use it? If so, yes.<br>
					By default, your work is COPYRIGHTED under an "all rights reserved" statement! That means you must give each person you give it to permission to use it.<br>
					<br>
					Even if you don't plan on making it open source or whatever, at least put an "(C) [firstname] [lastname] YEAR. All Rights Reserved" text as a license. This signifies that you don't want people to use this code, and may prevent someone from illegally using your code.
				</p>
				<h2>Everyone uses GPL. Should I</h2>
				<p>
					It depends on the project.<br>
					Personally, I don't think anything deserves to be GPLed, but that's just me.
					Here's the pros and cons about GPL:<br>
					<strong>Pros</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>No one can use your work without credit.</li>
						<li>People can't sell your code in their software (besides things such as install discs, etc. You can technically sell GPL'd software. In most cases it would just be pointless.)</li>
						<li>People give back their contributions.</li>
						<li>Any contributors get their credit.</li>
					</ol>
					<strong>Cons</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>You must license your project as GPL even if you use just a small portion of code</li>
						<li>You must make it open source</li>
						<li>You must state all significant changes made to original code</li>
						<li>Many things your linux distribution uses is GPL'd (even linux itself!)</li>
						<li>There are different versions of GPL which have different things that you can and can't do</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h2>What about LGPL</h2>
				<p>
					In my opinion, LGPL is a bit better than GPL.
					Again, it depends on the project.
					However, the main difference between GPL and LGPL is that LGPL is that with GPL, you must license the entire thing as GPL if you used GPL code. With LGPL, you can just license that portion of code as LGPL. You don't have to change the entire project's license.
					This makes it much more flexible when trying to use others' code as inspiration or just putting it in because it works. Otherwise, you might not be able to do that if you were using a license like the MIT license. You would have to decide between using this great code and changing the license to GPL or not using the code at all.
